- Objective:
   - What were you supposed to learn/accomplish?
     - how to use loops, functions, lists, and ramdom numbers all together in a program

 - Procedure:
   - What steps were followed and what techniques did you use to solve the problem?
     - First we made sure we understood the problem, then I completed the algorithm and Andrew wrote the code after.  
        Next, we went back and fixed any errors within the code and algorithm.
   - What were the Key concepts explored?
     - How to keep our program concise and efficient.

 - Results:
   - Did your results match what you expected to get?
     - Yes, Our results matched what we expected to get.
   - Did you try using various test cases, or extreme test cases?
     - We created a flowchart to test our algorithm before coding.
  
 - Reflection:
   - What challenges did you encounter? 
     - At first, we were unsure of which functions to use, but after going back and rereading the readme file we were able to figure it out.
   - How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
     - I followed the first 3 rules of programming by designing our program first with an algorithm, and then turning it into code,  
       and finally testing it to make sure it runs correctly and then fixing any errors.
   - Did you overcome them, and how? 
     - yes, we went back to reread the readme file as well as using our notes from class.
   - Any key takeaways? 
     - I found that reviewing the lecture notes about loops and functions helped a lot when I was experiencing challenges.
   - Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab? 
     - Yes, I definitely think I learned what I was supposed to for this lab and I really enjoyed completing it as well.
   - What was it like working with your partner?
     - I think Andrew and I worked well together. We were both able to help each other with different things. We also split up the work evenly,  
        I wrote the algorithm and Andrew wrote the code.
